##ðŸ“˜ ML Course Projects (BITS F464)
This repo contains the different machine learning projects I worked on during my ML course at BITS Pilani (BITS F464). Each folder has a separate project exploring different ML concepts like regression, classification, decision trees, CNNs and LSTMs â€” all implemented using Python and common libraries like scikit-learn, pandas and TensorFlow/Keras.
