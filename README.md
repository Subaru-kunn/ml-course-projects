# 📘 ML Course Projects (BITS F464)

This repository contains all the machine learning mini-projects I worked on during my **ML course (BITS F464)** at **BITS Pilani**.

Each folder is a self-contained project that explores a specific concept — including **regression**, **classification**, **decision trees**, **CNNs** and **LSTMs** — implemented using Python and libraries like:

> 🧰 `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `TensorFlow` and `Keras`
